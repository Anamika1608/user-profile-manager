# Take-Home Assignment (Progress Updated)

## Overview
This project is a **User Profile Management application** built with React, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL.  
The assignment involved enhancing the existing app by adding backend database integration, QR code functionality, and additional performance/security/feature improvements.  

I have successfully completed **Task 1, Task 2, and part of Task 3** (details below).
